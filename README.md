This project demonstrates the creation of a simple dynamic to-do list using vanilla JavaScript.
It includes functionality to add new items to the list and delete existing items.
Event handling is implemented to manage user interactions,with functions like AddtoDo for adding tasks and handleDelete for removing them. 
The project also showcases the use of window.onload for binding event listeners to DOM elements once the page is fully loaded.
